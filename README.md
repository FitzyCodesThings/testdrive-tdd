# TestDriveTDD

A simple experiment in adding TDD to my arsenal.

## Overview

Utilizes XUnit, Moq, and FluentAssertions to test service methods against an EF Core persistence model.

**This should not be considered complete or correct unit testing!**

I am learning the basics here to implement in future projects. Hope it'll help others that are just getting started with unit testing in .Net!

## Special Thanks

A lot of my thinking and methodology here is adapted from [@hassanhabib](https://github.com/hassanhabib) ([YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq28Bw9vzgU)) and the work he and his community are doing on the OtripleS project ([Github link](https://github.com/hassanhabib/OtripleS)).

HUGE thanks to Hassan for the motivation and guidance to get started with TDD (and a variety of other better practices).
