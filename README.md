# TestDriveTDD

A simple experiment in adding TDD to my arsenal.

## Overview

Utilizes XUnit, Moq, and FluentAssertions to test service methods against an EF Core persistence model.

**This should not be considered complete or correct unit testing!**

I am learning the basics here to implement in future projects. Hope it'll help others that are just getting started with unit testing in .Net!
